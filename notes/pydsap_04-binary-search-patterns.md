**NOTES ON SOLVING SEARCH & OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS USING BINARY SEARCH PATTERNS. üêçüîç**

Binary Search is more than just finding an element in a sorted array.

It‚Äôs a versatile pattern that applies to **searching, decision-making, and optimization problems** by repeatedly halving the search space.

---

## ‚ú® When to Use

- The input is **sorted** (array, matrix, or monotonic property).
- The problem asks for **first/last occurrence**, **boundary index**, or **decision-based minimum/maximum**.
- When brute force scanning is O(n) but you need **O(log n)**.

---

## ‚ö° Advantages

- Reduces search time from O(n) to O(log n).
- Works not only on arrays, but also on **answer ranges** (binary search on solution space).
- Forms the basis of many advanced algorithms (search trees, parametric search).

## üìù Example 1 ‚Äî Basic Binary Search

*Find an element in a sorted array.*

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example
print(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 7))  # Output: 3
```

---

## üìù Example 2 ‚Äî First and Last Occurrence

*Return the first index where target appears in a sorted array.*

```python
def first_occurrence(arr, target):
    left, right, result = 0, len(arr) - 1, -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1   # keep searching left
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result

print(first_occurrence([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], 2))  # Output: 1
```

---

## üìù Example 3 ‚Äî Search in Rotated Sorted Array

*Binary search can handle rotated arrays by checking which side is sorted.*

```python
def search_rotated(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        if arr[left] <= arr[mid]:  # left half sorted
            if arr[left] <= target < arr[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        else:  # right half sorted
            if arr[mid] < target <= arr[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return -1

print(search_rotated([4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 0))  # Output: 4
```

---

## üìù Example 4 ‚Äî Binary Search on Answer Space

*Find the smallest x such that x*x ‚â• target (integer square root).*

```python
def integer_sqrt(target):
    left, right, ans = 0, target, -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid <= target:
            ans = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return ans

print(integer_sqrt(10))  # Output: 3
```

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Classic Binary Search** ‚Üí find elements in sorted arrays.
- **Modified Binary Search** ‚Üí first/last occurrence, rotated arrays.
- **Answer Space Search** ‚Üí find minimum/maximum satisfying a condition.
- Think: *Is the search space monotonic?* If yes, binary search applies.
